# Implementation Workflow

This companion document outlines the segmented workflow referenced from the top-level skill guidance. The workflow is divided into five tasks, each with mandatory preconditions.

- [Shared Issue Understanding](shared-issue-understanding.md) – Task 2: Step 1
- [Implementation Planning](implementation-planning.md) – Task 3: Steps 2-3
- [Test Driven Development](test-driven-development.md) – Task 4: Step 4 + Preliminary Tests
- [Implementation](implementation.md) – Task 5: Implementation, Testing, and Review
- [Integration](integration.md) – Task 6: Steps 8-9

Follow these tasks sequentially whenever implementing an approved issue. The top-level skill keeps the decision tree, meta-task guidance, and important guardrails, while these files house the detailed step-by-step instructions for changes to source code, documentation, or AI skills.
