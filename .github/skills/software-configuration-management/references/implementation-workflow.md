# Implementation Workflow

This companion document outlines the segmented workflow referenced from the top-level skill guidance. The workflow is divided into four segments, each with mandatory supervision approvals between them.

- [Shared Issue Understanding](shared-issue-understanding.md) – Step 1: Issue Assessment & Approval
- [Implementation Planning](implementation-planning.md) – Steps 2-3: Branch Creation and Planning
- [Implementation Execution](implementation-execution.md) – Steps 4-7: Documentation, Testing, Implementation, and Review
- [Integration](integration.md) – Steps 8-9: Final Integration and Validation

Follow these segments sequentially whenever implementing an approved issue. The top-level skill keeps the decision tree, meta-task guidance, and important guardrails, while these files house the detailed step-by-step instructions for changes to source code, documentation, or AI skills.
